How to install ðŸ‘‰ï¼š [CustomHookLoader#README#Adding_a_hook](https://github.com/BakaFT/CustomHookLoader#usage)

# BetterTencentLCU

It's Tencent Server only so ignore it if you are playing on global server:)

# BenchKiller

Remove swapping cooldown in champion bench(At the top of champ-select in ARAM/ARURF mode)

It only contains a `ember` type hook.

I suggest you install this locally.

If you want to install it in remote, here is the CDN URL of it:
